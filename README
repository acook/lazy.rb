lazy.rb is an implementation of lazy evaluation in Ruby, similar to the facilities provided by R5 Scheme.

For lazy evaluation, it provides two functions: promise (similar to Scheme's delay) which takes a block for later evaluation, and demand (similar to Scheme's force), which forces its evaluation (if necessary) and returns its cached result.

Unlike some Scheme implementations, it is safe to pass ordinary values to force. Implicit evaluation is also supported, as the promise can be used directly in place of the computation's result.

Newer versions of the library also include an API for lazy streams.  Unlike
many lazy stream implementations, lazy.rb's streams are even (like Haskell's)
and the library attempts to make it easy.

lazy.rb is made available under the same license as Ruby.
