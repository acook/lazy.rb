lazy.rb is an implementation of lazy evaluation in Ruby, similar to the facilities provided by R5 Scheme.

For lazy evaluation, it provides two functions: promise (similar to Scheme's delay) which takes a block for later evaluation, and demand (similar to Scheme's force), which forces its evaluation (if necessary) and returns its cached result.

Unlike some Scheme implementations, it is safe to pass ordinary values to force. Implicit evaluation is also supported, as the promise can be used directly in place of the computation's result.

The newest feature of the library is asynchronous evaluation, which runs the
computation optimistically in an independent thread; demanding the result
will wait for the computation to complete if needed.

Note that promises are not threadsafe unless 'lazy/threadsafe' has been
required ('lazy/async' requires it indirectly).

lazy.rb is made available under the same license as Ruby.
