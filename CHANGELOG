--- %YAML:1.0
- version: 0.2
  date: 2005-12-10
  changes:
    lazy/stream.rb: added lazy streams with an Enumerable wrapper
    lazy.rb:
    - Lazy::Thunk becomes Lazy::Promise
    - Lazy::Promise#inspect won't force evaluation anymore, but becomes
      transparent once it is evaluated.  This makes life in irb much
      easier.  Thanks to Tom Payne for the idea.
    - rename force to demand (force is still available as an alias)
    - rdoc tweaks
    - dup reason backtrace rather than using it directly in DivergenceError
    README: added
    COPYING: added
    CHANGELOG: added

- version: 0.1
  date: 2005-10-05
